# Cognifyz-Project-1
This project, completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, involved the development of an interactive and data-driven dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard was designed to provide actionable insights for business decision-making, leveraging data from multiple sources and delivering real-time analytics in a visually compelling format.

Data Integration & ETL: 
     Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) data from various sources (Excel, SQL Server, and cloud-based systems) into Power BI for seamless reporting.

Custom Dashboards: 
     Developed tailored dashboards that provided stakeholders with insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales performance, customer demographics, and operational metrics.

DAX Calculations: 
    Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to implement custom measures and calculated columns, enhancing data modeling and report interactivity.

Visualizations: 
     Created a range of visual elements (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers) to simplify complex data and present it in an intuitive manner.

Automation: 
   Set up automated refresh schedules for the dashboard to ensure up-to-date data was always available for decision-making.

Performance Optimization: 
    Applied techniques such as query folding, data model optimization, and data compression to ensure the dashboard performed efficiently with large datasets.

Tools & Technologies:

Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations

SQL Server for data extraction

Microsoft Excel for data handling

Power Query for data transformation and cleansing.

The Power BI dashboard streamlined reporting processes, provided real-time insights, and significantly improved the organizationâ€™s ability to monitor key business metrics. It also reduced manual reporting time, offering automated, up-to-date analytics for enhanced decision-making.
